* Be sent via the HTTPS protocol
* Pass a specific API Key unique to each merchant, for authentication
* Originate from an allowed IP address (the allowed IP addresses will be configured for you when you register for the service)
* Include (at a minimum) the mandatory fields required for the specific request that is being made

For more details on how our API Keys work, see the [Security Overview](ob_secoverview.html).
